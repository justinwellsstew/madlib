	<p>{{femaleName}} was a {{jobTitle}} who loved technology. Although she loved parts of her job, she absolutely hated {{tediousTask}} and {{dirtyTask}}. So, {{femaleName}} met with her life mentor {{celebrity}} who told her to learn how to {{uselessSkill}} with Thinkful. Thinkful didn't offer a course on {{uselessSkill}} so she studied programming instead. </p> <p>What a great decision! With her new skills, {{femaleName}} built a(n) {{adjective}} robot named {{obnoxiousCelebrity}} that not only loved {{dirtyTask}} but did it {{hugeNumber}} times faster. </p>
